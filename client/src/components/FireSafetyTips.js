    <h1>Fire Safety Tips</h1>
    <p>At JJ Crackers, your safety is our top priority. Please follow these fire safety guidelines when handling and lighting crackers:</p>

    <h2>1. Adult Supervision</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always ensure that children are supervised by responsible adults while bursting crackers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Use Outdoors Only</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Crackers should only be used in open outdoor areas, away from buildings, vehicles, dry leaves, and flammable materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Maintain Distance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand at a safe distance once a cracker is lit. Never attempt to relight a cracker that didnâ€™t ignite properly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Keep Water Ready</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always keep a bucket of water or a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Wear Safe Clothing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Wear cotton clothes and avoid synthetic materials, which can catch fire easily.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. No Crackers in Hand</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never light or hold crackers in your hand. Always place them on the ground before lighting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Protect Your Eyes and Ears</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use earplugs and safety glasses to protect yourself from loud noises and flying sparks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Dispose Properly</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>After use, douse used crackers with water before disposing of them to avoid accidental fire.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Follow Local Laws</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow your local guidelines regarding the permitted types and timing of cracker usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Emergency Contact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In case of fire or injury, immediately contact local fire services or medical help.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Stay safe and celebrate responsibly. â€“ <strong>JJ Crackers Team</strong></p>
